<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    I am a web developer with a passion for learning new things. I have a background in teaching and I am currently
    working as a freelance web developer.
</p>
<p>
    I am a graduate of the <a href="https://www.appbrewery.co/">App Brewery</a> Full Stack Web Development course. Angila Yu is an excellent teacher and I highly recommend her courses. Her courses are available on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a>. I have also completed the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a> Responsive Web Design course. This is just the beginning of my journey to becoming a full stack web developer.
</p>
<p>
    I am currently learning <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> and <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>. While python is not a requirement for web development, it is a very popular language and I am interested in learning it. I am also learning Django because it is a popular framework for web development.
</p>
<p>
    As a Web developer, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail, my unequivocal love for making things, and my passion for learning new skills to create clean and efficient web applications. I have a passion for learning new things and I am always looking for new challenges.
